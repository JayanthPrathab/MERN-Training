    <h2>Day1</h2>
    <p>On the first day we've learnt what version control is, and its 2 broad categories along with various Git commands to add, commit and push files to our respective repositories.</p>
    The 2 types of VCS include
    <ol>
        <li>Centrlaized VCS</li>
        <li>Distributive VCS</li>
    </ol>

        <tr>
            <td>git init</td>
            <td>Initialises an empty local repository</td>

        <tr>
            <td>git add FILE_NAME</td>
            <td>Adds the selected files/folder name to the local repository</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>git commit -m "COMMIT_MESSAGE"</td>
            <td>commits the files to the staged files</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>git push -u origin BRANCH NAME</td>
            <td>Pushes the files to the global repository ie. to the repository </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>git remote add origin URL</td>
            <td>When we need to change the repository, we need to change the repository URL</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>git pull</td>
            <td>When we commit changes directly on GitHub(Global repository), we use this command to affect/save changes to the files in the 
                local repository
            </td>

    <h2>Day3</h2>
    <p>Day 3 of our training was important as we've learnt the basic types of CSS and their operations along with their priorities. They include</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Internal CSS</li>
        <li>External CSS</li>
        <li>Inline CSS</li>
    </ul>
    We've learnt inspecting a page, discovered the working of the box model that included margin, border, padding and content in order respectively.
